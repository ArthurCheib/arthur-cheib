    <p class="lead">
    <strong>My professional goal is to improve how decisions are taken in the Public Sector.</strong> My passion is training. But, when I am not making new courses
    or building software, I enjoy vacationing with my family and friends. 
    </p>

    <strong>My area of focus</strong> is applying data science to decision-making.
